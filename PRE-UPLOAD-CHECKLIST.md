   - Listed in `.gitignore`
   - Will NOT be uploaded to GitHub

2. **`.env.example` created** ✓
   - Template file with placeholder values
   - Safe to commit to GitHub
   - Helps other developers set up their environment

3. **`.gitignore` updated** ✓

   - Includes database files, virtual environments, and secrets

4. **`SECURITY.md` created** ✓
   - Security guidelines for contributors
   - Instructions for obtaining API keys
   - Best practices for handling credentials

## 🔐 Sensitive Data Found

Your `.env` file contains:

1. **Jira API Token**: `ATATT3xFfGF0...` (WILL NOT be uploaded)
2. **Slack Bot Token**: `xoxb-8585975896066...` (WILL NOT be uploaded)
3. **Gemini API Key**: `AIzaSyBcvxFLubOy...` (WILL NOT be uploaded)
4. **Email**: `subhashsrinivas36@gmail.com` (WILL NOT be uploaded)
5. **Database Password**: (WILL NOT be uploaded)

## ✓ Safe to Upload

The following files are SAFE and READY to upload:
- `app.py` - Uses `os.getenv()` to read from environment variables ✓
- `.gitignore` - Properly configured ✓
- `.env.example` - Contains only placeholders ✓
- `requirements.txt` - No credentials ✓
- `README.md` - Documentation only ✓
- All other Python files - No hardcoded secrets ✓

## 📋 Before Pushing to GitHub

1. **Double-check** that `.env` is not staged:
   ```bash
   git status
   ```
   (You should NOT see `.env` in the list)

2. **Add your files**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   ```

3. **Verify again** that `.env` is excluded:
   ```bash
   git status
   ```

4. **Commit your changes**:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Initial commit: Security incident response system"
   ```

5. **Push to GitHub**:
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- Your actual `.env` file will remain on your local machine only
- Other developers will need to create their own `.env` file using `.env.example` as a template
- If you've previously committed `.env`, you'll need to remove it from Git history (see SECURITY.md)

## 🎯 You're Ready!

Your code is now properly secured and ready to upload to GitHub. All sensitive credentials are protected and will not be exposed publicly.
